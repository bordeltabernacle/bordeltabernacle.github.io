Look into what is included when you start a new clojure project.

what are :keywords

Clojure collections (data structures), and the various functions to use with them.
- lists - ' & (list), (sort), (max), (map), (apply)
- vectors
- maps
- sets


Functional programming's immutable feature.  Create new collection rather than changing existing one.

Symbols - like variables, bind data to a name. `def` & `let`
Namespaces - `require`
Functions - `defn` / `fn`
Print - `println`
Docs - (doc)
