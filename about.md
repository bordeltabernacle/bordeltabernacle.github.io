My name is Rob Phoenix. I was born just before the 1980's. I used to be an
[artist](http://rm-phoenix.co.uk/), working in retail/hospitality/care/youth
work/education to support myself. Then, a few years back I fell in love, moved
to North Wales and started a family. I made a *'life decision'*, decided not to
be a teacher, and towards the end of 2014 I completed an MSc in Computer
Networking and got my CCNA. This was an interesting time in networking, still
is, and talk of Network Automation and Software-Defined was rife.  So I started
to learn Python, because I was shit-scared I wasn't going to get a job and
wanted to arm myself with as many skills as possible.  Luckily, through some
perseverance, luck and kindness from others, before completing my MSc I started
working for a large UK VAR as an Alpha/Beta Testing Lab Engineer. Very quickly,
because of the little Python knowledge I had, I became the *'Scripting Guy'*,
something that unnerved me at first, but that I quickly embraced. And in late 2015
my boss agreed that my job title should be changed to Developer. And, [now][now].
