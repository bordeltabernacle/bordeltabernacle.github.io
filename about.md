My name is Rob Phoenix. I was born just before the 1980's. I used to be an
[artist](http://rm-phoenix.co.uk/), working in retail/hospitality/care/youth
work/education to support myself. Then, a few years back I fell in love, moved
to North Wales and started a family. I made a *'life decision'*, decided not to
be a teacher, and towards the end of 2014 completed an MSc in Computer
Networking and got my CCNA. This was an interesting time in networking, still
is, and talk of Network Automation and Software-Defined was rife.  So I started
to learn Python, because I was shit-scared I wasn't going to get a job and
wanted to arm myself with as many skills as possible.  Luckily, through some
perseverance, luck and kindness from others, straight outta college I started
working for a large UK VAR as an Alpha/Beta Testing Lab Engineer. Very quickly I
became the *'Scripting Guy'*, something that unnerved me at first, but that I
have now taken and am trying to run with.

In late 2015 my boss agreed that my job title should be changed to
Developer.  I'm smitten with functional programming and my time these days is
spent building stuff with Elixir, Phoenix Framework, Python & JavaScript
continually exploring and learning, fiddling about with VMware and Cisco virtual
and physical machines, vagrant up-ing, git commit-ing, docker run-ing, gazing
into my Linux laptop, avoiding my Windows laptop, attempting to understand
databases, asking my son to say 'Please', blowing raspberries on my daughter's
chubby legs, and having a glass of wine with the greatest woman in the world.
I *frickin'* love it, all of it.

This blog is an open space for me to keep notes on what I'm doing, explore and
share knowledge and experience, and will hopefully make me document more. I have
a huge knowledge gap, don't judge me because I don't get it yet, I will, but I'm
probably going to be running around in the dark for a while before I find the
light switch. I'm all about constructive criticism and learning from others so
please feel free to tear into what I write here and tell me what I'm doing
wrong. I want to be better.

And, the name, `Bordeltabernacle`? When I met my girlfriend we started living
together in a small caravan.  Due to it's temporary and shabby nature we took to
referring to it as the *Bordel/Tabernacle*.  We still have the caravan but no
longer live in it. I've always quite liked the contrasting nature of the name,
each part a counterpoint to the other, describing a place where the
contradictions of life happen.
