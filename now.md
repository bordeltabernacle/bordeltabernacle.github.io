So, currently I am...

- Using [Elixir][ex] at work to script Cisco configuration templates.
- Getting deeper into the JS stack, learning Node, Electron & MongoDB.
- Determined to better understand Linux, and use it more, more, more.
- Studying network automation and programmability.
- Learning [Welsh][w], my kids will start going to a local Welsh medium primary
  school in the next year or so, and I want to be able to talk with them in Welsh.
- Going to the gym ~3 times a week, getting myself fitter now that I mostly sit
  and code.
- Reading about Islamic militancy.
- Slowly improving my bird & tree identification skills, which are currently pretty laughable.
- Building a wood-fired wooden hot tub in the back garden for drinking prosecco in.
