I'm following this idea from [Rob Conery][rc], who got it from
[Derek Sivers][ds].

So, currently I am...

- writing & learning [Elixir][ex], which is becoming my language of choice, replacing
  Python. I am using it at work for a variety of different applications.
- writing an IP address library in Elixir, which is basically a simple
  re-imagining of Python's [netaddr][na] library.
- practising daily exercises in [touch typing][tt], & [Spacemacs keybindings][sk].
- Starting to [contribute][c] to Open Source, mostly in documentation, but it still
  feels excellent.
- Getting my head around database design.
- Chipping away at learning JavaScript.
- Learning [Welsh][w], my kids will start going to a local Welsh medium primary
  school in the next year or so, and my eldest could count to 10 in Welsh before
  he could in English, and I want to be able to talk with them in Welsh.
- Reading about the [Blues][b] & [Stoicism][s]
- Going to the gym ~3 times a week, getting myself fitter now that I mostly sit
  and code.
